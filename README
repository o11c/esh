Nacreous EggShell is a shell with no major limitations nor features.

To build, run:
  make esh

There is also a useful tool, savetty (make savetty) that can restore your
terminal to a (somewhat) sane state even if a buggy application crashes.

Note: esh's builtin line editing does not work correctly for some forms of
input. Particularly, UTF-8 and special keys (such as arrows) do not work
at all; neither does the 'refresh' action. I would fix this, but I have too
many other things that I need to do ...
